# 🧠 Mini Text Editor — Built from Scratch in Python

A minimalist **text editor** built with **Python** and **PySide6**, designed to explore **data structures** and **low-level text editing logic**.

This project focuses on implementing the editor’s core mechanics from scratch — text buffer, cursor, and rendering.
It’s inspired by [Austin Henley’s “Challenging Projects Every Programmer Should Try”](https://austinhenley.com/blog/challengingprojects.html).
